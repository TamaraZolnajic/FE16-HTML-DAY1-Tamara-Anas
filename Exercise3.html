    <p> <div>She's got a smile that it seems to me</div>  
        <div>Reminds me of childhood memories</div>
        Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky <br>
        Now and then when I see her face <br>
        <div>She takes me away to that special place</div>
       <div>And if I stare too long, I'd probably break down and cry</div>
        <span>Woah, oh, oh</span> 
        <span>Sweet child o' mine</span>
        <span>Whoa, oh, oh, oh</span> 
        <div>Sweet love of mine</div> 
        She's got eyes of the bluest skies <br>
        </p>
